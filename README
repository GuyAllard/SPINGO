SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
To run SPINGO and its supporting python scripts requires:
    - A modern Linux operating system.
    - Python2.7 or greater.

If the included SPINGO binaries fail to run on your system, then you will need to compile them from source. This requires additional dependencies. The full procedure and requirements can be found in the section COMPILING FROM SOURCE at the end of this document.


INSTALLATION:
No installation is necessary to use SPINGO. The program can be run from within the extracted SPINGO tarball. This document will assume that you have extracted the tarball in your home directory to give a folder named '/home/your_username/spingo_1.0'.This location will be referred to from hereon in as 'SPINGODIR'.
If you have extracted the tarball in a different location, use that path in place of 'SPINGODIR'.


GENERATION OF SPECIES DATABASE
Before SPINGO can be used to classify amplicons, a species specific database needs to be prepared.
At the time of release, this database is derived from the 16S data files named 'release11_2_Archaea_unaligned.fa.gz' and 'release11_2_Bacteria_unaligned.fa.gz' which are available from the Ribosomal Database Project (rdp.cme.msu.edu). 
If you already have these files, place a copy of them into the 'SPINGODIR/database/' directory. 
If you do not have these files, they can be downloaded automatically as part of the following step.

Change to the ‘SPINGODIR/database’ directory.
Execute the command:
    make

If the 16S data files are not present, you will be asked if you wish to download them. Enter 'y' at the on-screen prompts to download these files. If you choose not to download the files automatically, you will need to download them manually, place them into 'SPINGODIR/database/' and re-run 'make' to complete the process.

At the end of this process, the database folder should now contain a file named 'RDP_11.2.species.fa' which SPINGO will use as its reference database.


RUNNING SPINGO
To check that SPINGO will run on your system, change into 'SPINGODIR' and execute the command:
    ./spingo -h

If this command does not output usage information to the screen, you will need to compile the program from source. See the section 'COMPILING FROM SOURCE' at the end of this document for further instructions.

To run spingo with sensible default values, on a hypothetical amplicon sequence file named reads.fa, using the species specific database created previousl, and saving the output to a file named results.out:
    SPINGODIR/spingo -d SPINGODIR/database/RDP_11.2.species.fa -i path/to/reads.fa > path/to/results.out

Note that spingo writes to stdout (the screen), so the ‘>’ operator is used to redirect this output to a file.


INDEX FILE
When spingo is run, the reference database is converted internally to an efficient indexed structure. This process can take several minutes depending on the kmer size chosen and the size of the database. By default, this index is created each time the program is run. The index can be saved for reuse by using the --write-index (-w) option, e.g.:
    SPINGODIR/spingo --write-index -d SPINGODIR/database/RDP_11.2.species.fa -i path/to/reads.fa > path/to/results.out

The index file is saved alongside the raw fasta database in the database directory. Once this is done, any use of the same database and kmer size will reuse the cached index file, saving several minutes per run.

An additional program, spindex can be found alongside spingo. This program can be used to pre-generate these index files. See the section SPINDEX at the end of this document for more information. 


SPINGO PARAMETERS
--help (-h)                 Display the help message

--version (-v)              Display the program version

--kmersize (-k) <int>       Kmer size. 
                            <int> is an integer in the range [1,15] (default=12).

--bootstrap (-b) <int>      Number of bootstrap samples to use.
                            <int> is a positive integer (default=10).

--subsample (-s) <int>      The proportion of kmers to use for each bootstrap subsample.
                            <int> is an integer > 0 (default is equal to kmersize).

--processors (-p) <int>     The number of processor threads to use.
                            <int> is an integer > 0 (default = 1).

--writeindex (-w)           A flag indicating that the index should be saved for future use.
                            See the INDEX FILE section above.

--database (-d) <path>      Location of the fasta format database.

--input (-i) <path>         Location of the input file.

--no-header (-n)            A flag indicating that column headers should NOT be written to the output file.


OUTPUT FORMAT
Spingo writes output in a plain text format with 6 tab separated columns. The first line of the output file consists of the column headers. The output of the header can be supressed by using the --no-header option (see above). The column desctiptions are as follows: 
Column 1:   QUERY   Query sequence identifier.
Column 2:   SCORE   Similarity score.
Column 3:   L1      Taxonomic assignment at level 1 (e.g. clostridium group).
Column 4:   L1_BS   Bootstrap score of the level 1 assignment.
Column 5:   L2      Taxonomic assignment at level 2 (e.g. species).
Column 6:   L2_BS   Bootstrap score of the level 2 assignment.


RESULTS SUMMARY
An additional script, spingo_summary can be found alonside spingo and spindex. This can be used to create a convenient summary of the results from a spingo run. e.g.
    spingo_summary path/to/results.out
 
Usage:
    spingo_summary [-h] RESULTS_FILE [--level <1,2>] [--similarity <float>] [--threshold <float>] [--percent]

Parameters:
--help (-h)                 Display the help message

RESULTS_FILE	            Path to the input file (the output from spingo)

--level (-l) <1,2>          Taxonomic level to summarize.
                            1 = Clostridium group
                            2 = Species

--similarity (-s) <float>   Similarity score cutoff, in the range [0,1]. Default is 0.5.

--threshold (-t) <float>    Bootstrap cutoff for the current level [0,1]. Default is 0.8.

--percent (-p)              A flag indicating that the summary should be expressed as percentages instead of raw read counts.


SPINDEX
An additional program, spindex is supplied which can be used to pre-create index files before running spingo. Invoking spindex with the --help parameter will display a short list of available options. 
An example command to create an index for the RDP_11.2.species.fa database with a kmer size of 12 and using 4 processor threads:
    SPINGODIR/spindex -k 12 -p 4 -d SPINGODIR/database/RDP_11.2.species.fa


ALTERNATIVE TAXONOMY:
In addition to the taxonomy.map file which defines the two level hierarchy consisting of clostridium group and species, an alternative file named genus_spp_taxonomy.map is included in the database folder. This file can be used to create a database with a hierarchy consisting of genus and species. To do this, change to the 'SPINGO/database' folder, and execute:
    make TAX=genus_spp_taxonomy.map OUT=RDP_11.2.genus_spp.fa
You can then use the RDP_11.2.genus_spp.fa as the database file.

It is also possible to edit the existing taxonomy.map (or make a new one) to create your own taxonomic labels, the format of this file is self explanatory.


64bit or 32bit
By default, SPINGODIR/spingo and SPINGODIR/spindex are symolic links to the 32bit precompiled binaries located in SPINGODIR/dist/32bit/. The 32bit binaries should run on both 32bit and 64bit operating systems.
If you wish to use the precompiled 64bit versions instead, then you can update the symbolic links to point at the binaries located in SPINGODIR/dist/64bit/
e.g. from within SPINGODIR
    ln -f -s dist/64bit/spingo spingo
    ln -f -s dist/32bit/spindex spindex


COMPILING FROM SOURCE
SPINGO should compile on any POSIX compliant operating system with the following pre-requisites installed:
    - g++ (tested with g++ >= 4.1.2)
    
    - BOOST development libraries (>= 1.33), specifically:
        - Boost::program_options
        - Boost::serialization
        - Boost::thread

    For RedHat derived distributions (eg CentOS) these can be installed using the distributions boost-devel package

    For Debian derived distributions (eg Ubuntu) these can be installed individually using the packages
        libboost-program-options-dev
        libboost-serialization-dev
        libboost-thread-dev

    For other distributions, search your package maintainer for the appropriate packages.

Compilation is simple. Change to the 'SPINGODIR/source' directory and execute:
    make
This will compile the executables and update the symbolic links in SPINGODIR to use the compiled versions.

If you wish to revert to using the original pre-compiled binaries,
    make clean
from within the 'SPINGODIR/source' directory will restore the original symbolic links.
